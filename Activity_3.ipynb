A stack is a collection of elements that has two operations; to add (push) elements in the collection or to remove (pop) elements. Note that in a stack, only the recently added element will be removed using the pop function. To implement a stack into a program, you need to create 3 main functions for the stack which are Stack() which creates a stack, push() which adds elements at the top of the stack, and pop() which removes the element at the top of the stack. You can also create a function size() and isEmpty() which returns the size of the stack and checks whether the stack has elements or not respectively. \n",
